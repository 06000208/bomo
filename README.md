My take on the classic Mattel card game Uno, playable in your web browser. I'm sorry for naming it this way.

## Why?
Why the hell did I spend the time making this? Let me express the deep frustration my friends and I have with Ubisoft's Uno.

If you want to play Uno on your PC, it will cost you $10 to buy on Steam, and you can't even use Steam to play it - you need to make an Ubisoft account and install Uplay. It is not clear you need to do this until you've already bought and launched the game for the first time, or unless you've read previous reviews of the game. If you've just made your account for the first time, you then have to figure out where your Steam friends are because you're running this through Uplay and have none on that platform.

After all of this setup, Steam (or the digital platform you initially bought it on) becomes worthless in your efforts to play Uno, a mere roadblock. All of this is a *major* annoyance for people like me who dont want to have to manage multiple different accounts and applications just to play a card game.

Really, how the fuck does a triple A gaming company mess up a card game? Suck my cock, Ubisoft.
