My take on the classic Mattel card game Uno, playable in your web browser.

## Why?
Uno costs $10 to buy on Steam, and you can't even use Steam to play it - you need to make an Ubisoft account and use the Ubisoft game launcher. It is not clear you need to do this until you've already bought and launched the game for the first time, or unless you've read previous reviews of the game.

Suck my cock, Ubisoft.
